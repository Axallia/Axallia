Hi!
My name is Axallia, Axa for short. (Usually my nickname everywhere is `AxaTheArcticFox`)
I'm mostly working with minecraft stuff like datapacks, resourcepacks, and, really rarely, mods.
I additionally started learning OpenGL alongside C++, for now I'm quite terrible at it but that's okay cus I'll get better over time (I hope)

Also, you want to commission me a datapack/resourcepack/vanilla shader/general python code? Ask me at my discord (@axathearcticfox), I usually respond in several hours over there!
(and don't ask me anything on twitter, i forgot password from it, literally.)
